# Test Output Directory

This directory contains images generated during real API tests for manual inspection.

## Location

```
/Users/teristam/Documents/code/reader3/tests/output/
```

## Current Images

Generated images are saved in the `images/` subdirectory:

```
tests/output/images/
└── generated_ch99_Single_Test_Image_scene1.png  (1.74 MB)
```

## How to Generate Test Images

### Quick Single Image Test (Fast - ~10 seconds)

```bash
# Generate one image for quick inspection
uv run pytest tests/test_save_real_images.py::test_generate_single_image_for_inspection -v -s -m requires_api
```

### Full Chapter Test (Slower - ~30 seconds, 3 images)

```bash
# Generate complete chapter with 3 scenes
uv run pytest tests/test_save_real_images.py::test_save_images_to_inspect -v -s -m requires_api
```

## Viewing Images

### From Terminal

```bash
# Open the images folder
open tests/output/images/

# Open specific image
open tests/output/images/generated_ch99_Single_Test_Image_scene1.png
```

### From Finder

Navigate to:
```
/Users/teristam/Documents/code/reader3/tests/output/images/
```

## Cleanup

To remove all test images:

```bash
rm -rf tests/output/images/*
```

Or keep them for reference - they won't interfere with tests.

## Notes

- Images are generated with `force_regenerate=True` so they're always fresh
- The `output/` directory is gitignored, so images won't be committed
- Each test run overwrites previous images with the same name
- Real API tests consume API credits - use sparingly
